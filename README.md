### Hello ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I work on collecting and analyzing data on human and animal mobility and proximity, using wearable proximity sensors. I co-founded and co-lead the [SocioPatterns](https://www.sociopatterns.org) collaboration.
- I develop embedded systems for work and for fun. I am mostly familiar with the nRF51 and nRF52 SoC by Nordic Semiconductors.
